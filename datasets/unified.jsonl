But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars.

Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a \"sustainable, equitable\" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.", "sentiment": "neutral", "toxicity": "safe", "topic": "mood issues"}

We aren't requiring that enough social good be done.

The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school.
